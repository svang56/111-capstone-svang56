# Capstone Description
    
My project is a text adventure game. It features an adventurer who is on an "Adventure
Quest" and has come to defeat the Dragon. The objective of the game is to battle monsters
and become stronger in order to defeat the Dragon. However, there is also a Black knight 
who is almost as fearsome as the Dragon. As you enter the game, the user will be given 
options to navigate throughout the game.
(the following is a general run down of my game)
There are four different areas within my game.
There is a "Town," "Forest," "Dungeon," and "Castle." The town consists of a shop
where players can buy potions to replenish their health and Inn where players
are able to rest at to also replenish health. The next 3 locations, which are the
"Forest," "Dungeon," and "Castle," each have three monsters and functions that
are unique to their location. The "Forest" contains a goblin, black bear, and wolf as
monsters. Also, players have the option to search the forest to look for random 
items. In the "Dungeon," there are 3 monsters which are: the zombie, slime, and dragon.
This is where the player will find and battle the dragon. However, the player must be
a certain level before the player is able to fight and defeat it. At the "Castle," 
the three enemies are a guard, magician, and black knight. The black knight at the 
"castle" is also considered a boss because of how powerful it is bit is not as
significant as the dragon. In addition, the player can search the castle for
chests in hopes of finding money. However, there is a chance that the player will
have to battle an enemy at the castle when they search for treasure chests.
